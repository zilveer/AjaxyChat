echo "<span class=\"smalltxt\">Recently Fisk did not agree with the timeframe of this website being completly finished. 
Currently all normal chat functions work. Chat, PM's, Rooms, and Admin features. 
All of my hard work is going to be deleted because Fisk states \"it didn't meet the timeframe\".
Please email/chat with Fisk and tell him to not delete this new chat system for Teen Support Chat. <span>";
