<h1>Ajaxy Chat</h1>

Ajaxy Chat is a simple to use chat script that will allow your users to get real-time chat feedback. Uses MySQL for database, and is super configurable. Would love to see some new features! Script might be buggy at times, I hope to see your updates!

<h2>Installation</h2>

- Pull all this fancy stuff to your server
- Create a new MySQL database for ajaxychat
- Open DATABASE.sql and insert it into your new made database
- Edit file  db.php  and insert your database values
- Make sure folder  /images/uploads  has 755 or 777 permissions.

Then, make a username by entering it in the lower textbox. Why not, change your password/email/chat name on the right side. After you made a username...

- Go into database, and change admin to 1  (for your username)
- Test it out, and enjoy. Look around in functions and script to better understand AjaxyChat.

- Ban/Kick needs to actually ban/kick user (ban user from site is ban/kick > time. Users->Ban/Kick in Mysql
- Better logging in admin area




Ajaxy Chat is fully open source and is GPL friendly. You can use it for commercial projects, open source projects, or really just about whatever you want. If you made any updates to the script, I would really appreciated to see them posted! =D
